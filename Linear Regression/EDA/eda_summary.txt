#üìä EDA Summary: Fish Weight Prediction

    üìÅ Dataset Overview:
    The dataset includes features: Length1, Length2, Length3, Height, Width, and Weight (target).

    Goal: Predict Weight of a fish based on physical dimensions.

    1Ô∏è. Target Distribution (Weight)
    Skewness: Right-skewed distribution (positively skewed)
    Action: Log transformation suggested (log1p) to normalize it for regression

    2Ô∏è. Boxplot of Target
    Shows 3 clear outliers above ~1400g
    Interpretation: These could be large fish, not necessarily data errors
    Action: Retain them; apply log-transform to reduce their influence

    3Ô∏è. Feature Distributions
    All features (Length, Height, Width) are also right-skewed
    Action: Scaling (StandardScaler) is recommended; log-transform not mandatory unless strong skew persists after scaling

    4Ô∏è. Multivariate Outlier Check (Boxplot)
    Weight again shows major spread and outliers
    Features appear tightly packed and low-variance compared to the target
    Action: No feature outlier removal needed at this stage

    5. Correlation Matrix
    Length1, Length2, Length3 are ~0.99 correlated ‚Üí strong multicollinearity

    Weight correlates well with:
    Length1/2/3 ‚Üí ~0.92
    Width ‚Üí ~0.89
    Height ‚Üí ~0.72

    Action:
    Drop 2 of the 3 length features or average them
    Possibly drop Height if minimal improvement during training

    6Ô∏è. Target vs Feature Relationship
    Visual trend: Non-linear relationship (looks quadratic or exponential)
    Linear model might underfit, so try Polynomial Regression (deg=2)

    7. Boxplot of Weight by Species
    Trend : Clear species-wise separation in weight
    Observation : Pike and Bream are heaviest; Smelt is lightest
    Action : Species is a high-impact categorical variable ‚Äî should be one-hot encoded
